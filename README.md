# Internations Coding Task

Simple Users and Groups relations based task. I spend around 4 hours on the task and this is the result. However, the task is not fully complete as I had a time constraint.

Current features:

- Add groups.
- List of groups.
- Delete a group when there's no user.
- Add users and assign at least one group while adding.
- List of users.
- Delete users.

N.B. I use JavaScript standard style to format my code and it also notifies about unused variables or imports. No starter like `create-react-app` or others were used. Just configured a basic WebPack setup to run the development process.
